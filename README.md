# cml_dll
via command line + vs2022's cl.exe link.exe to generate windows DLL.


VS IDE is too complicated that it automately creating so many things, behind the sea-wave, I just wanna to get the right knowledge.
so, base on vs2022, I strip out all the complicated shell. just leave its kernel. to show it by simply command line.
this can works togather with IDE's operation. So, just have fun, cheers, cml-ers :) !
